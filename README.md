# ACM Certificate Quota

Make sure this is set to 2000 per region where we require certificates, submit support ticket if required. Although the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-limits.html) says it's already set at this, by default it's actually only set to 20, which means you'll run out quickly.

* Region: Asia Pacific (Sydney)  
  Limit: Number of ACM certificates  
  New limit value: 2000
* Region: US East (Northern Virginia)  
  Limit: Number of ACM certificates  
  New limit value: 2000
